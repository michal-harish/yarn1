SIMPLE YARN EXECUTOR
====================

- This is a "Hello Yarn" executuor and at the moment serves as a template
- The idea for future is to have the generic part (net.imagini.yarn1) built as an artefact and have it a pure dependency in the implementing application
- Branches for different versions of Hadoop/Yarn will come, this one is based on 2.3.0-cdh5.0.3


FEATURES
--------
- quick and easy access to Yarn resources by extending YarnMaster class 
- allows running custom Yarn distributed application directly from IDE or as packaged thin jar


RUNING FROM COMMAND LINE
------------------------
mvn package
yarn jar target/yarn1-example.jar

RUNNING FROM IDE
----------------
run HelloYarn1Launcher under the test sources  as Java Application
# if your IDE doesn't support maven dependency plugin then run `mvn process-sources` before running the main class and also every time you change dependencies 


QUICK SETUP OF LOCAL YARN CLUSTER
---------------------------------
1) download 2.3.0-cdh5.0.3 bundle from cloudera, unapck and cd into the content
2) start yarn managers ./sbin/yarn-daemon.sh start resourcemanager && ./sbin/yarn-daemon.sh start
3) start hadoop cluster ./sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh start namenode && ./sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh start secondarynamenode && ./sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh start datanode
WITH SINGLE-NODE LOCAL YARN CLUSTER


TODO
----
- built in synchronization using environment-provided zookeeper for things like barrier behaviours
- i.e. drift needs all containers first allocated and running and then execute
- distribute non-provided dependencies programatically
