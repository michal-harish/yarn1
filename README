Simple Yarn Executor
====================

- This is a "Hello Yarn" executuor and at the moment serves as a template
- The idea for future is to have the generic part (net.imagini.yarn1) built as an artefact without bundling the big hadoop jars inside 
- Branches for different versions of Hadoop/Yarn will come, this one is based on 2.3.0-cdh5.0.3
