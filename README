Simple Yarn Executor
====================

- This is a "Hello Yarn" executuor and at the moment serves as a template
- The idea for future is to have the generic part (net.imagini.yarn1) built as an artefact without bundling the big hadoop jars inside 
- Branches for different versions of Hadoop/Yarn will come, this one is based on 2.3.0-cdh5.0.3


RUNING FROM COMMAND LINE
------------------------
mvn package
./scripts/run


RUNNING FROM IDE
----------------
run HelloYarn1 as Java Application - this will work until you add some non-default hadoop classpath dependencies


TODO
----
# built in synchronization using environment-provided zookeeper for things like barrier behaviours, i.e. drift needs all containers running first
# distribute non-provided dependencies programatically

FEATURES
--------
- quick and easy way access to Yarn resources by extending YarnMaster class 
- allows running custom Yarn distributed application directly from IDE or as packaged thin jar
